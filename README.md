# Dynlightslib
Welcome to Dynlightslib.
Dynlightslib is a mcfunction library that allows you to easily manage lights in Minecraft. It integrates three mechanisms: lights, temporary lights, and dynamic lights.

## Why sould I use Dynlightslib ?
### Performance.
Dynlightslib is first of all the only library allowing to manage lights dynamically in Minecraft. Thanks to its storage-based and not entity-based operation, it allows for much better performance, such as being able to manage more than 1000 lights each tick, without any optimization mod and without lag (test performed in a classic world, without spawn gamerule, with Intel Core i5 7200U + processor rendering, Minecraft Vanilla)
